# Docsavior - Place to find saviors for your study

Docsavior is a mobile application designed to help students and learners find the documents they need for their studies. Whether you're searching for study materials or sharing your own documents with others, Docsavior is the place for you. 

## Motivation

Nowadays, while you can find many educational documents on the Internet, some specific documents are still very hard to locate. There is a lack of platforms dedicated to sharing these resources freely, and sometimes you find what you need, but it requires a payment. As students, we understand the importance of copyright, but we also recognize that not everyone can afford to pay for these resources.

This is why we created this application - to provide a place where learners can contribute and find documents for their studies without any fees. Our goal is to create a community where everyone can post their documents and find what they need for free.

## Application description

This application functions like a social media platform where users can post and browse a wide variety of educational documents. It is developed in Java using the Android Studio platform. During the development process, we encountered various challenges, such as integrating APIs, managing databases, and handling file storage. This is our first mobile project, and we have learned a lot along the way.

We hope that in the future, this application will grow into a thriving learning community. We are committed to continually improving it to make it the best resource for every learner.
